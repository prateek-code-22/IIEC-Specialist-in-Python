### Here we are launching OS using docker by python script and html form.

1. Enter the OS name you want to give in html form and submit it.
2. Python script will get executed and launch os by docker in terminal.
3. For running docker you have to disable some security use **sentenforce 0** command in terminal before launching.

Fact: Docker launches the OS within seconds :rocket:
